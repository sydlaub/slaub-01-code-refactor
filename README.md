# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

The purpose of this code refactor for the Horiseon website is to improve the original code to make it more accessible and sustainable long-term. These changes are important for a number of reasons that affect user experinece as well as improving the search engine optimization. This code refactor did not change the way that the website is displayed; it was only intended to clean up the code on the back end. 

The specific tasks that were completed during the refactor include:
- Editing the HTML to include semantic HTML elements that better categorize the section of code.
- Consolidating repetitive CSS segments.
- Adding a descrptive title to the webpage
- Added alt text attributes to images to improve accessibility.
- Edited HTML to ensure headings are in sequential order.
